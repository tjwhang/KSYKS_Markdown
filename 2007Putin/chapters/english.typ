Thank you, very much dear Madam Federal Chancellor, Mr Teltschik, ladies and gentlemen! 

I am truly grateful to be invited to such a representative conference that has assembled 
politicians, military officials, entrepreneurs and experts from more than 40 nations. 

This conference’s structure allows me to avoid excessive politeness and the need to speak in 
roundabout, pleasant but empty diplomatic terms. This conference’s format will allow me to 
say what I really think about international security problems. And if my comments seem unduly 
polemical, pointed or inexact to our colleagues, then I would ask you not to get angry with me. 
After all, this is only a conference. And I hope that after the first two or three minutes of my 
speech Mr Teltschik will not turn on the red light over there. 

Therefore. It is well known that international security comprises much more than issues relating 
to military and political stability. It involves the stability of the global economy, overcoming 
poverty, economic security and developing a dialogue between civilisations. 

This universal, indivisible character of security is expressed as the basic principle that “security 
for one is security for all”. As Franklin D. Roosevelt said during the first few days that the 
Second World War was breaking out: “When peace has been broken anywhere, the peace of all 
countries everywhere is in danger.” 

These words remain topical today. Incidentally, the theme of our conference – global crises, 
global responsibility – exemplifies this. Only two decades ago the world was ideologically and 
economically divided, and it was the huge strategic potential of two superpowers that ensured 
global security. 

This global stand-off pushed the sharpest economic and social problems to the 
margins of the international community’s and the world’s agenda. And, just like any war, the 
Cold War left us with live ammunition, figuratively speaking. I am referring to ideological 
stereotypes, double standards and other typical aspects of Cold War bloc thinking. 

The unipolar world that had been proposed after the Cold War did not take place either. 

The history of humanity certainly has gone through unipolar periods and seen aspirations to world 
supremacy. And what hasn’t happened in world history? 

However, what is a unipolar world? However, one might embellish this term, at the end of the 
day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one 
centre of decision-making. 

It is world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the 
end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the 
sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within. And this certainly has nothing in common with democracy. Because, as you know, democracy 
is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority. 

Incidentally, 
Russia – we – are constantly being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who 
teach us do not want to learn themselves. 

I consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today’s world. 
And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in today’s – and precisely in today’s – world, then the military, political and economic resources would not suffice. 

What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation. Along with this, what is happening in today’s world – and we just started to discuss this – is a tentative to introduce precisely this concept into 
international affairs, the concept of a unipolar world. 

And with which results? 

Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems. Moreover, they have caused new human tragedies and created new centres of tension. 
Judge for yourselves: wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished. Mr 
Teltschik mentioned this very gently. And no less people perish in these conflicts – even more 
are dying than before. Significantly more, significantly more! 

Today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in 
international relations, force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts. As 
a result, we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any one of these 
conflicts. Finding a political settlement also becomes impossible. 

We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law. And 
independent legal norms are, as a matter of fact, coming increasingly closer to one state’s legal 
system. One state and, of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its 
national borders in every way. This is visible in the economic, political, cultural and educational 
policies it imposes on other nations. Well, who likes this? Who is happy about this? 

In international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according 
to so-called issues of political expediency, based on the current political climate. And of course, 
this is extremely dangerous. It results in the fact that no one feels safe. I want to emphasise this – no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will 
protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race. 

The force’s dominance inevitably encourages a number of countries to acquire weapons of mass 
destruction. Moreover, significantly new threats – though they were also well-known before – 
have appeared, and today threats such as terrorism have taken on a global character. I am 
convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the 
architecture of global security. 

And we must proceed by searching for a reasonable balance 
between the interests of all participants in the international dialogue. Especially since the 
international landscape is so varied and changes so quickly – changes in light of the dynamic 
development in a whole number of countries and regions. Madam Federal Chancellor already mentioned this. The combined GDP measured in 
purchasing power parity of countries such as India and China is already greater than that of the 
United States. And a similar calculation with the GDP of the BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, 
India and China – surpasses the cumulative GDP of the EU. And according to experts this gap 
will only increase in the future. 

There is no reason to doubt that the economic potential of the new centres of global economic 
growth will inevitably be converted into political influence and will strengthen multipolarity. 

In connection with this the role of multilateral diplomacy is significantly increasing. The need 
for principles such as openness, transparency and predictability in politics is uncontested and 
the use of force should be a really exceptional measure, comparable to using the death penalty 
in the judicial systems of certain states. 

However, today we are witnessing the opposite tendency, namely a situation in which countries 
that forbid the death penalty even for murderers and other, dangerous criminals are airily 
participating in military operations that are difficult to consider legitimate. And as a matter of 
fact, these conflicts are killing people – hundreds and thousands of civilians! 

But at the same time the question arises of whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various 
internal conflicts inside countries, to authoritarian regimes, to tyrants, and to the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction? As a matter of fact, this was also at the centre of the question 
that our dear colleague Mr Lieberman asked the Federal Chancellor. If I correctly understood 
your question (addressing Mr Lieberman), then of course it is a serious one! Can we be 
indifferent observers in view of what is happening? I will try to answer your question as well: 
of course not. 

But do we have the means to counter these threats? Certainly, we do. It is sufficient to look at 
recent history. Did not our country have a peaceful transition to democracy? Indeed, we 
witnessed a peaceful transformation of the Soviet regime – a peaceful transformation! And what 
a regime! With what a number of weapons, including nuclear weapons! Why should we start 
bombing and shooting now at every available opportunity? Is it the case when without the threat 
of mutual destruction, we do not have enough political culture, respect for democratic values 
and for the law? 

I am convinced that the only mechanism that can make decisions about using military force as 
a last resort is the Charter of the United Nations. And in connection with this, either I did not 
understand what our colleague, the Italian Defence Minister, just said or what he said was 
inexact. In any case, I understood that the use of force can only be legitimate when the decision 
is taken by NATO, the EU, or the UN. If he really does think so, then we have different points 
of view. Or I didn’t hear correctly. The use of force can only be considered legitimate if the 
decision is sanctioned by the UN. And we do not need to substitute NATO or the EU for the 
UN. When the UN will truly unite the forces of the international community and can really 
react to events in various countries, when we will leave behind this disdain for international 
law, then the situation will be able to change. Otherwise the situation will simply result in a 
dead end, and the number of serious mistakes will be multiplied. Along with this, it is necessary 
to make sure that international law have a universal character both in the conception and 
application of its norms.

And one must not forget that democratic political actions necessarily 
go along with discussion and a laborious decision-making process. 

Dear ladies and gentlemen!

The potential danger of the destabilisation of international relations 
is connected with obvious stagnation in the disarmament issue. 

Russia supports the renewal of 
dialogue on this important question. 

It is important to conserve the international legal 
framework relating to weapons destruction and therefore ensure continuity in the process of 
reducing nuclear weapons. 

Together with the United States of America we agreed to reduce our nuclear strategic missile capabilities to up to 1700–2000 nuclear warheads by 31 December 
2012. Russia intends to strictly fulfil the obligations it has taken on. We hope that our partners will also act in a transparent way and will refrain from laying aside a couple of hundred 
superfluous nuclear warheads for a rainy day. And if today the new American Defence Minister 
declares that the United States will not hide these superfluous weapons in warehouse or, as one 
might say, under a pillow or under the blanket, then I suggest that we all rise and greet this 
declaration standing. It would be a very important declaration. 

Russia strictly adheres to and intends to further adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons as well as the multilateral supervision regime for missile technologies. 
The principles incorporated in these documents are universal ones. 

In connection with this I 
would like to recall that in the 1980s the USSR and the United States signed an agreement on 
destroying a whole range of small- and medium-range missiles but these documents do not have 
a universal character. 

Today many other countries have these missiles, including the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea, the Republic of Korea, India, Iran, Pakistan and Israel. Many countries are working 
on these systems and plan to incorporate them as part of their weapons arsenals. And only the 
United States and Russia bear the responsibility to not create such weapons systems. 

It is obvious that in these conditions we must think about ensuring our own security. At the same 
time, it is impossible to sanction the appearance of new, destabilising high-tech weapons. 
Needless to say, it refers to measures to prevent a new area of confrontation, especially in outer 
space. Star wars is no longer a fantasy – it is a reality. In the middle of the 1980s our American 
partners were already able to intercept their own satellite. In Russia’s opinion, the militarisation of outer space could have unpredictable consequences 
for the international community and provoke nothing less than the beginning of a nuclear era. 
And we have come forward more than once with initiatives designed to prevent the use of 
weapons in outer space. 

Today I would like to tell you that we have prepared a project for an agreement on the prevention of deploying weapons in outer space. And in the near future it will 
be sent to our partners as an official proposal. Let’s work on this together. Plans to expand certain elements of the anti-missile defence system to Europe cannot help but disturb us. Who needs the next step of what would be, in this case, an inevitable arms race? I deeply doubt that Europeans themselves do. 

Missile weapons with a range of about five to eight 
thousand kilometres that really pose a threat to Europe do not exist in any of the so-called 
problem countries. And in the near future and prospects, this will not happen and is not even 
foreseeable. And any hypothetical launch of, for example, a North Korean rocket to American 
territory through western Europe obviously contradicts the laws of ballistics. As we say in 
Russia, it would be like using the right hand to reach the left ear. 

And here in Germany I cannot help but mention the pitiable condition of the Treaty on 
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 

The Adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe was signed in 1999. It took into account a new geopolitical reality, namely the 
elimination of the Warsaw bloc. Seven years have passed and only four states have ratified this 
document, including the Russian Federation. NATO countries openly declared that they will 
not ratify this treaty, including the provisions on flank restrictions (on deploying a certain 
number of armed forces in the flank zones), until Russia removed its military bases from 
Georgia and Moldova. Our army is leaving Georgia, even according to an accelerated schedule. 
We resolved the problems we had with our Georgian colleagues, as everybody knows. There 
are still 1,500 servicemen in Moldova that are carrying out peacekeeping operations and 
protecting warehouses with ammunition left over from Soviet times. We constantly discuss this 
issue with Mr Solana and he knows our position. 

We are ready to further work in this direction. 
But what is happening at the same time? Simultaneously the so-called flexible frontline 
American bases with up to five thousand men in each. It turns out that NATO has put its 
frontline forces on our borders, and we continue to strictly fulfil the treaty obligations and do 
not react to these actions at all. 

I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernisation 
of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious 
provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom 
is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our western partners made 
after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact? Where are those declarations today? No one even 
remembers them. But I will allow myself to remind this audience what was said. I would like 
to quote the speech of NATO General Secretary Mr Woerner in Brussels on 17 May 1990. He 
said at the time that: “the fact that we are ready not to place a NATO army outside of German 
territory gives the Soviet Union a firm security guarantee”. Where are these guarantees? 

The stones and concrete blocks of the Berlin Wall have long been distributed as souvenirs. But 
we should not forget that the fall of the Berlin Wall was possible thanks to a historic choice – 
one that was also made by our people, the people of Russia – a choice in favour of democracy, 
freedom, openness and a sincere partnership with all the members of the big European family. 

And now they are trying to impose new dividing lines and walls on us – these walls may be 
virtual, but they are nevertheless dividing, ones that cut through our continent. And is it possible 
that we will once again require many years and decades, as well as several generations of 
politicians, to dissemble and dismantle these new walls? 

Dear ladies and gentlemen! 

We are unequivocally in favour of strengthening the regime of non
proliferation. The present international legal principles allow us to develop technologies to 
manufacture nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes. And many countries with all good reasons want 
to create their own nuclear energy as a basis for their energy independence. But we also 
understand that these technologies can be quickly transformed into nuclear weapons. 

This creates serious international tensions. The situation surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme 
acts as a clear example. And if the international community does not find a reasonable solution 
for resolving this conflict of interests, the world will continue to suffer similar, destabilising 
crises because there are more threshold countries than simply Iran. We both know this. We are 
going to constantly fight against the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Last year Russia put forward the initiative to establish international centres for the enrichment 
of uranium. We are open to the possibility that such centres not only be created in Russia, but 
also in other countries where there is a legitimate basis for using civil nuclear energy. Countries 
that want to develop their nuclear energy could guarantee that they will receive fuel through 
direct participation in these centres. And the centres would, of course, operate under strict IAEA 
supervision. 

The latest initiatives put forward by American President George W. Bush are in conformity 
with the Russian proposals. I consider that Russia and the USA are objectively and equally 
interested in strengthening the regime of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and their deployment. It is precisely our countries, with leading nuclear and missile capabilities, 
that must act as leaders in developing new, stricter non-proliferation measures. Russia is ready 
for such work. We are engaged in consultations with our American friends. In general, we 
should talk about establishing a whole system of political incentives and economic stimuli 
whereby it would not be in states’ interests to establish their own capabilities in the nuclear fuel 
cycle, but they would still have the opportunity to develop nuclear energy and strengthen their 
energy capabilities. 

In connection with this I shall talk about international energy cooperation in more detail. 
Madam Federal Chancellor also spoke about this briefly – she mentioned, touched on this 
theme. In the energy sector Russia intends to create uniform market principles and transparent 
conditions for all. It is obvious that energy prices must be determined by the market instead of 
being the subject of political speculation, economic pressure or blackmail. We are open to 
cooperation. Foreign companies participate in all our major energy projects. According to 
different estimates, up to 26 percent of the oil extraction in Russia – and please think about this 
figure – up to 26 percent of the oil extraction in Russia is done by foreign capital. Try, try to 
find me a similar example where Russian business participates extensively in key economic 
sectors in western countries. Such examples do not exist! There are no such examples. 
I would also recall the parity of foreign investments in Russia and those Russia makes abroad. 
The parity is about fifteen to one. And here you have an obvious example of the openness and 
stability of the Russian economy. Economic security is the sector in which all must adhere to 
uniform principles. We are ready to compete fairly. For that reason, more and more 
opportunities are appearing in the Russian economy. Experts and our western partners are 
objectively evaluating these changes. As such, Russia’s OECD sovereign credit rating 
improved, and Russia passed from the fourth to the third group. And today in Munich I would 
like to use this occasion to thank our German colleagues for their help in the above decision. 
Furthermore. As you know, the process of Russia joining the WTO has reached its final stages. 
I would point out that during long, difficult talks we heard words about freedom of speech, free 
trade, and equal possibilities more than once but, for some reason, exclusively in reference to 
the Russian market. 

And there is still one more important theme that directly affects global security. Today many 
talk about the struggle against poverty. What is actually happening in this sphere? On the one 
hand, financial resources are allocated for programmes to help the world’s poorest countries – 
and at times substantial financial resources. But to be honest — and many here also know this – linked with the development of that same donor country’s companies. And on the other hand, 
developed countries simultaneously keep their agricultural subsidies and limit some countries’ 
access to high-tech products. And let’s say things as they are – one hand distributes charitable 
help and the other hand not only preserves economic backwardness but also reaps the profits 
thereof. The increasing social tension in depressed regions inevitably results in the growth of 
radicalism, extremism, feeds terrorism and local conflicts. And if all this happens in, shall we 
say, a region such as the Middle East where there is increasingly the sense that the world at 
large is unfair, then there is the risk of global destabilisation. 

It is obvious that the world’s leading countries should see this threat. And that they should 
therefore build a more democratic, fairer system of global economic relations, a system that 
would give everyone the chance and the possibility to develop. 

Dear ladies and gentlemen, speaking at the Conference on Security Policy, it is impossible not 
to mention the activities of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 
As is well-known, this organisation was created to examine all – I shall emphasise this – all 
aspects of security: military, political, economic, humanitarian and, especially, the relations 
between these spheres. What do we see happening today? We see that this balance is clearly 
destroyed. People are trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument designed to 
promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of countries. And this task is also being 
accomplished by the OSCE’s bureaucratic apparatus which is absolutely not connected with 
the state founders in any way. Decision-making procedures and the involvement of so-called 
non-governmental organisations are tailored for this task. These organisations are formally 
independent, but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control. 

According to the founding documents, in the humanitarian sphere the OSCE is designed to 
assist country members in observing international human rights norms at their request. This is 
an important task. We support this. But this does not mean interfering in the internal affairs of 
other countries, and especially not imposing a regime that determines how these states should 
live and develop. It is obvious that such interference does not promote the development of 
democratic states at all. On the contrary, it makes them dependent and, as a consequence, 
politically and economically unstable. We expect that the OSCE be guided by its primary tasks 
and build relations with sovereign states based on respect, trust and transparency. 

Dear ladies and gentlemen! In conclusion I would like to note the following. We very often – 
and personally, I very often – hear appeals by our partners, including our European partners, to 
the effect that Russia should play an increasingly active role in world affairs. In connection 
with this I would allow myself to make one small remark. It is hardly necessary to incite us to 
do so. Russia is a country with a history that spans more than a thousand years and has 
practically always used the privilege to carry out an independent foreign policy. 

We are not going to change this tradition today. At the same time, we are well aware of how 
the world has changed and we have a realistic sense of our own opportunities and potential. 
And of course, we would like to interact with responsible and independent partners with whom 
we could work together in constructing a fair and democratic world order that would ensure 
security and prosperity not only for a select few, but for all. 

Thank you for your attention.
